# EuclideanRandomGraph

## Context

This GUI and associated classes create a drawing of the Geometric Random Graph, inside a 500x500 box. The GUI allows the user to change the number of points, along with the connection radius. Each press of the Redraw button generates a new random graph, with the points distributed uniformly.
